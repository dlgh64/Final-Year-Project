#How to Select a Project Topic
1.	Choose two to three general areas related to your course of study that you would like to work in after you graduate. Your project is your main chance to differentiate yourself from the crowd.
2.	For each one, spend one hour on news.google.co.uk trying to figure out what has been interesting in this area this year. Get rid of any ideas that have had no development this year.
Do not bother with what was interesting in the past. When you graduate you will not be competing with your Father, but with the motivated, up-to-date graduates of similar courses from one hundred other universities.
3.	For each of the ideas that you have not rejected yet, read three to five journal papers, and document each of these using the Journal Logs. Start with ACM Computing Surveys or IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials. If you cannot find anything relevant to your idea in any of these two journals, you are doing something wrong
4.	Compile a two-page report with the following content.
 
#Project Title
1.	What have others done in this area over the last four years.
2.	Divide it into 2 to 3 sections on subproblems that most people have worked on/showed interest in.
•	Section 1
•	Section 2
•	Section 3
3.	What will the end product look like? Who will it be useful for?
4.	What will you use as your test-bed, which programming framework, simulator, real device, standards, mathematical model, legal framework …?
5.	What is your evaluation path? What will be the metrics of your product’s success? Will you test it on real users, against a publicly available data set, against other similar products, …?
6.	References in Harvard style.
